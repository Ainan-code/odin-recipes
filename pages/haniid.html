    <p> <em>Haniid</em> is a special type of barbecue  where lamb meat is used to prepare. the process is a bit complicated but I can witness its definitely worth it.</p>
    <p>First we dig a the ground for about 1 metre deep and width, then we put cement and place wood for fire at the deep of the dig. Secondly we place the meat at about half distance from the fire and we cover the hole. </p>
    <p>The more wait the tender the meat becomes and some people even enjoy it the following day</p>
